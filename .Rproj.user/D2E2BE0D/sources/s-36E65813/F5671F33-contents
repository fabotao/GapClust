\title{Detecting rare cells from expression profiles by single cell RNA-seq.}
\usage{
GapClust(data, k=200)
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{ a data matrix, normalized expression profiles of single cells, where rows are genes and columns are cells. }
  \item{k}{ number of neighbors to consider and the upper limit of minor cluster size. }
}
\description{
GapClust takes advantage of the gap between minor cluster and neighbouring
abundant cluster to let rare cells within minor cluster stand out through
delicately designed statistics. Meanwhile, GapClust does not struggle to
search for rare cell informative genes like most of the competitors,
but learns the cluster size as well as rare cells using simple arithmetic calculation.
