# GapClust
## Detecting rare cells from expression profiles by single cell RNA-seq.
GapClust takes advantage of the gap between minor cluster and neighbouring abundant cluster to let rare cells within minor cluster stand out through delicately designed statistics. Meanwhile, GapClust does not
struggle to search for rare cell informative genes like most of the competitors, but learns the cluster size as well as rare cells using simple arithmetic calculation.
