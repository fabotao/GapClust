Description: More about what it does (maybe more than one line)
    Use four spaces when indenting paragraphs within the Description.
    GapClust takes advantage of the gap between minor cluster and neighbouring
    abundant cluster to let rare cells within minor cluster stand out through
    delicately designed statistics. Meanwhile, GapClust does not
    struggle to search for rare cell informative genes like most of the competitors,
    but learns the cluster size as well as rare cells using simple arithmetic calculation.
